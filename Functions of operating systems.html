                        <ol start="2"><li><strong>Memory management:-</strong> Memory management module performs the task of allocation and de-allocation of memory space to programs in need of this resources.</li></ol>
                        <ol start="3"><li><strong>File management</strong>:- It manages all the file-related activities such as organization storage, retrieval, naming, sharing, and protection of files.</li></ol>
                        <ol start="4"><li><strong>Device Management</strong>: Device management keeps tracks of all devices. This module also responsible for this task is known as the I/O controller. It also performs the task of allocation and de-allocation of the devices.</li></ol>
                        <ol start="5"><li><strong>I/O System Management:</strong> One of the main objects of any OS is to hide the peculiarities of that hardware devices from the user.</li></ol>
                        <ol start="6"><li><strong>Secondary-Storage Management</strong>: Systems have several levels of storage which includes primary storage, secondary storage, and cache storage. Instructions and data must be stored in primary storage or cache so that a running program can reference it. </li></ol>
                        <ol start="7"><li><strong>Security</strong>:- Security module protects the data and information of a computer system against malware threat and authorized access.</li></ol>
                        <ol start="8"><li><strong>Command interpretation</strong>: This module is interpreting commands given by the and acting system resources to process that commands.</li></ol>
                        <ol start="9"><li><strong>Networking:</strong> A distributed system is a group of processors which do not share memory, hardware devices, or a clock. The processors communicate with one another through the network. </li></ol>
                        <ol start="10"><li><strong>Job accounting</strong>: Keeping track of time &amp; resource used by various job and users.</li></ol>
